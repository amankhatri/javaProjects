/*database gives you an ability to store data in form of tables which contains columns and rows. 
 * rows are called the records and the columns are called columns in database technology. While installing 
 * the mysql workbench please remember 
 * 1) the port number use default, do not change and also note it down --3306
 * 2) keep username root if you change it note it -root
 * 3) password - please note down password 
 * 
 * Steps 
 * 1) make a new connection 
 * 2) after creadng new connection, double click it
 * 3) create schemas before creating tables 
 * 		it is a container where we can create tables , we can create as many tables as we
 * 		want in schemas
 * 
 * 
 * Since java can not talk to db directly, there was a new set of class developed called JDBC, that 
 * stand for JAva DataBase Connectivity.
