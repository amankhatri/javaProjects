A session handleing is a concept where server maintains the session for each user. 
	Server can be used be millions of users simultaneously. and each user has a session id associated with it. 
	session Id is an id created by the server for each connection or request sent to the server from browser. 
	Session id is only created once and destroyed when we close the browser.
	Session Id is shared on one server between different servlets. Session id is shared by all servlets
	Now we can conclude that sessionId is a common factor between all the web applications
Values can be stored and retrieved in a session . for example if someone is buying something online, he may have a shopping caart and to keep adding stuff in shopping cart. we may have to store information of each purchase so that user can check out everthing togeather.

Sessions are used to store the information temporily as soon as the user closses the browser the session and the stored infor are destroyed.
