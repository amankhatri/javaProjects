In JSP we don't have doget or do post methods. JSP uses implicit objects. Implicit objects are already created objects for you. You don't have to create 
Response response = new Response() you can just go ahead and use them

3) Response- Is a type of http servlet response
4) OUt  - it is of type print writer 
5) Sessions - it is of type HttpSession / The values stored in session is only valid duing session
6) application - it is of type Application, it will allow you to store some values using key value pair. the values stored in application object can be retrieved anywhere in the appication. 
7) pageContext - we can store somevalues using this. This obeject can store values just like session and application for this we have to set the scope
